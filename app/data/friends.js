// My JS goes here!

// Determine the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:
// Convert each user's result into a simple array of numbers (ex: [5, 1, 4, 4, 4, 2, 5, 4, 1])
// With that done, compare the difference between the current user's scores against those from other users, question by question.
// Add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference
// Example:
// User 1: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
// User 2: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1]
// Total difference: 2+1+2 = 5
// Use the absolute value of the differences. No negative solutions. Ex: Your app should calculate both 5-3 and 3-5 as 2.
// The closest match will be the user's most compatible friend.
// Display the result as a modal pop-up.
// The modal pop-up should display both the name and the picture of the closest match.
